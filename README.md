This Python script establishes a SQLite database to illustrate a many-to-many relationship between advisors and students. It creates tables for advisors and students, along with a junction table named StudentAdvisor to handle the many-to-many relationship. After populating the tables with sample data, the script executes queries utilizing SQL joins, specifically a left join, to determine the number of students assigned to each advisor. This showcases the use of joins to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information from the database. The script serves as a demonstration of database schema creation, data insertion, querying, and the implementation of many-to-many relationships using joins in SQL.
